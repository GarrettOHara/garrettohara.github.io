            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a DevOps Engineer at NBC Sports Next and Co-Founder/SWE at Bucket Inc. I obtained by B.S. in
                Computer Science, Minor of Mathematics at San Diego State University.
                I'm currently pursing a M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech University.
            </p>
            <p>
                At NBC, I'm learning a ton from some of our more senior engineers. I maintain and develop new Terraform
                modules to manage our AWS resources with Infrastructure as Code principles.
                I have also developed a microservice to reload staging and development databases from their production
                instances. This solution leverages Lambda Functions written in Python which
                orchestrated by AWS Step Functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Bucket, I am responsible for our product's scalability and security. Bucket leverages a gamut of
                cloud services from both AWS and GCP to bring new features into our client's hands.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                We recently reached a limit in query complexity when hosting data with Google Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL Document Database. I architected a solution to serve our clients with an auto-scaling load-balanced RESTful API hosted by AWS. The API performs CRUD requests to a PostgreSQL hosted by AWS RDS. I translated the data into a relational representation and backfilled the production data. We have been able to solve previous limitations by representing certain data in a Relational manner and querying using SQL. The main upside to this solution is the foundation that was laid to build more complex solutions.

                In my free time, I'm an avid tech enthusiast, and an acoustic guitarist.
