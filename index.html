            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
I'm the Backend Software Engineer of Bucket Inc and a student at San Diego State University. I have a B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics.
</p><p>
At Bucket, I am responsible for our product's scalability and security. I have taken a profound interest in cloud computing. Bucket leverages a gamut of cloud services from both AWS and GCP to bring new features into our client's hands. 
</p><p>
We recently reached a limit in query complexity when hosting data with Google Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL Document Database. I architected a solution to serve our clients with an auto-scaling load-balanced RESTful API hosted by AWS. The API performs CRUD requests to a PostgreSQL hosted by AWS RDS. I translated the data into a relational representation and backfilled the production data. We have been able to solve previous limitations by representing certain data in a Relational manner and querying using SQL. The main upside to this solution is the foundation that was laid to build more complex solutions.
</p><p>
 In my little free time, I am an active member of the Cyber Defense Team at SDSU, avid tech enthusiast, and an acoustic guitarist.
