            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a DevOps Engineer at NBC Sports Next and Co-Founder/SWE at Bucket Inc. I obtained by B.S. in Computer Science, Minor of Mathematics at San Diego State University. 
                I'm currently pursing a M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech University.
            </p>
            <p>
                At NBC, I'm learning a ton from some of our more senior engineers. I maintain and develop new Terraform modules to manage our AWS resources with Infrastructure as Code principles.
                I have also developed a microservice to reload staging and development databases from their production instances. This solution leverages Lambda Functions written in Python which
                orchestrated by AWS Step Functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Bucket, I am responsible for our product's scalability and security. Bucket leverages a gamut of cloud services from both AWS and GCP to bring new features into our client's hands. 
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                We recently reached a limit in query complexity when hosting data with Google Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL Document Database. I architected a solution to serve our clients with an auto-scaling load-balanced RESTful API hosted by AWS. The API performs CRUD requests to a PostgreSQL hosted by AWS RDS. I translated the data into a relational representation and backfilled the production data. We have been able to solve previous limitations by representing certain data in a Relational manner and querying using SQL. The main upside to this solution is the foundation that was laid to build more complex solutions.
            </p> -->

                In my free time, I'm an avid tech enthusiast, and an acoustic guitarist.
